EXP1 : Desgine a circuit to blink a LED

Circuit Diagram: 

Concept : An arduino is a on board microcontroller. 
And it can be programmed via the language Processing to turn a LED on for a certain period of time
and turn it off in a loop.To control the amount of time the LED will be on and the amount of time it will 
be off can easily be decided by a predefined function i.e delay(), this function take time as the argument(in millisecond).

Appratus : Arduino board, LED, Resistance of 220ohm and Jumper Wires.

Problems and Troubleshooting : 
a) LED is not turning on : Check for the polarity and make sure its P end is connected to the cathode 
   and  N end is connected to the anode.
b) Arduino Board is not working : Make sure that the pins are not shorted. Connect USB type A to B 
   properly and reupload the sketch.
   
Learning Outcomes:
a)Learned to use the following arduino Methods/functions:-
                                                  1)digitalWrite();
                                                  2)pinMode();
                                                  3)delay();
b)Structure of the a Arduino sketch.
c)Learned to connect the components in a correct manner.
